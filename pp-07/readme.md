# Production Problem 07: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, GNOME, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Gnome Desktop:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/interaction/data-entry/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: Only the required information for signing in on the website is 
displayed on the front page: The username and password, in addition to the logo. This eliminates all 
extra clutter.

* HCI Guidline Two (URL): https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/visual-design/layout/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: I gave a third of a page to the logo. Below it, I made the buttons relatively large so that they can be
clicked easily, and I also added a small amount of space between the labels. The Forgot password is 
towards the very button, and the login button is a little smaller and towards the bottom right due
to the fact that most people are right handed.

* HCI Guidline Three (URL):
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
