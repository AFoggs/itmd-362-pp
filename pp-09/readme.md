# Production Problem 09: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items. Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.
