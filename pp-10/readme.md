# Production Problem 10: A/B Testing on the Cheap

## The Problem

Locate an interface component on a website that you use frequently that you think could be improved. The improvement should be minor.

Take a screenshot of the interface on both a mobile and desktop device. Then, sketch or illustrate your alternate/"b" test. Finally, describe modification and the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write in order to conduct the test.

## Deliverables

* Screenshots of the interface component on mobile and desktop, placed in this directory (`pp-10/`)

* Sketch or illustrate (e.g., in Photoshop) your alternate/"b" test, placed in this directory (`pp-10/`)

* A text description of the modification, and a description of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write for the test (you do *not* have to write the actual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, however)

It is difficult for the user to sign up when landing on the page because it is unclear. As a result, 
I am adding a sign up section to the home page.

In the HTML, there would be a section dedicated to sign up, with a form that has the labels and questions
asking for necessary information (Name & Email, etc.) to crete an account, only visible on the homepage.

In the JavaScript, it will verify the details of that were entered and alert the user if there is an
error or if they've succesfully signed up, redirected them to the appropriate pages.

In the CSS, that section would have a boarder and be approximately 25% of the page and fixed in one 
position so that users can sign up quickly when landing on the site without being redirected, but
also make sure that if they scroll down they aren't annoyed by the section constantly begging them 
to sign up.
