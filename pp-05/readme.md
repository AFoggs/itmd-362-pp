## ITMD 362 Production Problem 5: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the color you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode Default with Text; you can start at this URL if you like: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

1. An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=53+0k0km5lzd83p4C9FPAyauYSv
Your Rationale: These are cooler, relaxing colors, similar to the gamecube. I was going towards a feel of using
gaming as a way to escape one form of existence into entering another. The stress isn't exactly reduced,
but rather converted into another form of energy that can be expended in a healthier fashion.

2. A triadic color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=32e0u0kpctAC2S0DnRZhNfJhNfJ
Your Rationale: I was trying to encapsulate the new spring feeling along with the multitude new bright and
exciting colors overall.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for a private messaging app

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=33G050kkmaccEiqf-cooJ7muc4j
Your Rationale: I wanted to display privacy and secrecy, but also an element of suspense. I don't like this
one much at all though.

4. A monochromatic color palette for advertising a course on Ruby on Rails

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=15-050ksvk8kcrGpyoBy5fGJBaj
Your Rationale: Ruby is red, so I found the hex value for Ruby red to entice people by assosciating the color
ruby with the course name.
