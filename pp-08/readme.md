# Production Problem 08: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the pp-08/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object: Wave Brush

* Visceral: The Brush has a handle that curves perfectly to allow for the fitting on ones thumb and 
index finger to grasp the brush. This sleek design combined with the How the brand "Wav" looks like 
a wave to symbolize waves makes it a very good looking brush.

* Behavioral: The brush is very easy to hold. The bristles are hard enough and oriented in the perfect
way, and after a few weeks of brushing, I did notice the development of Waves in my hair.

* Reflective: I really love the way the brush looks and how I can recognize someone else who is trying
to get waves by seeing that they have the same brush as myself. I also have a special tool that I 
can attribute my waves to, which makes me feel a bit more proud.

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 2 MyIIT redesign:

1. Functional: More than anything, the user must be able to log into the website and quickly and easily get their task done.
2. Simple: Keep It Simple; the website should be designed to house only a few functions and nothing more.
3. Elegant: Despite being simple, the webpage must also be visually appealing and catch the users eye while being memorable and easily identifiable
